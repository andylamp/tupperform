Tupper's Self-Referential formula in MatLab

This is a quick 'n dirty implementation of Tupper's Self-Referential formula [1] 
using MatLab. Unforunately it takes quite a bit to run and requires the
symbolic toolbox.

It can also be used for images color or not which are converted into b/w images
as well as truncated to fit into the 17x107 grid that the formula covers (if they
are not already).

Hope this helps.
